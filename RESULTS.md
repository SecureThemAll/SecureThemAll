\* Programs were executed sequentially

## Toolsâ€™ capability to repair security vulnerabilities: 

The repair status for each repair attempt is one of the following: 
1) **Fails Repair** if the tool fails to execute;
2) **Fails Sanity** Check if the sanity check fails positive tests or pass negative tests on the original program;
3) **Fails Fault Localization** if the sanity checks fail after instrumentation to collect info (code coverage) to perform fault localization;
4) **No Candidate Patches** if the tool does not generate candidate patches;
5) **Candidate Patches** if the tool generates candidate patches that do not fix the vulnerability;
6) **Repair** if the proposed patch passes all the tests.

## Tool's maintainability: 
The maintainability is the percentage of passing positive tests for considering all negative tests pass.
